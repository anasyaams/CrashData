# Crash Data

The Crash dataset offers detailed information on vehicle crash from 2016-2023. There are some potential primary objective for analyzing this dataset:
- Identifying accident hotspots and improving road safety?
- Understanding the factors contributing to severe accidents?
- Analyzing the impact of weather or road conditions on accidents?
- Investigating the role of driver behavior in accidents?

Based on the dataset, here are some areas that I have explored:
1. Geographic Analysis
   - Correlation between location and accident severity
   - Investigate if Route Type, Cross-Street Type, Off-Road Description have more accidents
2. Temporal Analysis
   - Accident trends over time: Analyze accident frequency by day, week, month, or year
   - Peak accident hours: Identify time periods with the highest accident rates
   - Impact of weather and surface conditions on accidents: Study the relationship between weather, surface condition and accident frequency
3. Road Conditions and Infrastructure
   - Impact of Traffic Control on accidents: Study the relationship between Traffic Control patterns and accident frequency
   - Lighting conditions: Investigate the influence of light conditions on accident rates
4. Accident Characteristics
   - Collision type analysis: Identify the most common types of collisions
   - Driver behavior analysis: Explore the impact of driver distractions, substance abuse, and speeding on accidents
   - Vehicle factors: Analyze the role of vehicle type, make, model, and year in accident causation
